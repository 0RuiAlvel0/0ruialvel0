## Hi there 👋

More information about me, posts on tech and development stuff (mostly codeigniter-related) and a cool tech-related newsletter you can subscribe to, 
is here [on my personal site](https://site.supertechman.com). See you there or see you here on GitHub or see you on X. Or on all of these places.

I have been a developer since I do not know when (that's how long ago it was) but only recently have I started using GitHub regularly following some changes to my life. The best place to connect with me is over on X.
